# push_swap
This project is about order alhorythm. you have two stacks of random number. you give a stack as arguments and the program can only execute some operations
pa pb sa sb ..

for this i made 3 algorithm. first is a brut force for little stack i just test every pertinent combination to find the quickest solution.
For middle stack I made a basic recursive ordering if it is above of under a middle point calculated with the content of the stack. then i order every little stack recursively.
for very big stack i made an algorithm ordering the number following their binary code.
